Simply math game for kids between 8-9 years old. Targets are desktop and android tablets.

The project is based on Qt5 and needs the android SDK and NDK if you plan to run in under android. 
The UI was tested on an Acer Iconia A700. For smaller devices (i.e. Phones) the UI will not fit.

The game is basic: the kid has to resolve some randomly selected basic math operations. After 10 hits a cartoon picture appears.
Currently, the pictures are embedded in the resource file, so no way to change them without recompilation.
